# Tesina - PacH
**Lucio Nardelli - _Director_ Hernán Ponce de León**

### Description

 Parse logs (as .xes or .txt Files) and calculate the minimum convex hull using Pyhull (https://pythonhosted.org/pyhull)
 of the  Parikh's vector of the the events in the traces.

 We use two different high-level techniques to handle large logs: projection and sampling

 After getting the convex hull, some automatic simplifications are made in order to get a "nicer" model.

 As a final step, the resulting PNML is generated according to the international standard.

### Installation
 In order to use it, some requirements are that must be met.
 It can be done via Pip:

      pip install -r requirements.txt

 or see the file `requirements.txt` for an exhaustive list or dependencies.

### Contents and Usage

**`parser.py`**

Used for parsing the log file and get the Parikh's vector representation of the traces.

**Usage**:

    ./parser.py <LOG filename> [--verbose]

If `--verbose` is no used, just a summary is printed. Otherwise  a full representation of the traces will we printed to the standard output.

**`negative_parser.py`**

Similar to the previous, but only the full trace is converted to a Parikh's vector, not the prefixes.

**Usage**:

    ./negative_parser.py <negative XES LOG filename> [--verbose]

**`qhull.py`**

Search, representation and simplification of a Convex Hull.
Points can be a list of lists or a file with the list of lists as the first line of it.

**Usage**:

    Usage: ./qhull.py <points> [--debug][--verbose]

**`pach.py`**

A wrap up of the elements necessary for:

  - Parsing
  - Getting the convex hull
  - Applying the automatic simplifications w.r.t. the negative traces
  -Generation of the Petri Net according to the *Petri Net Markup Language* (PNML http://www.pnml.org/)
  - Generation of an output file of performance statistics.

**Usage**:

    Usage: ./pach.py <LOG_filename> [--debug][--verbose]
    [--negative <Negative points filename>] [max_coefficient]]
    [--sampling [<number of samplings>] [<sampling size>]]
    [--projection [<max group size>] [<connected model>]]
    [--smt-matrix [<timeout>]]
    [--smt-iter [<timeout>]]
    [--sanity-check]

**_Arguments_**:

  - LOG_filename : The file where the positive log is

    - Negative_points_filename>
    - `[max_coefficient]`: Optional argument. Only try to remove facets with at least one coefficient bigger than max_coefficient.
  - `--sampling` : Whether to do sampling or not
    - `number of samplings`:  Number of samples to get
    - `sampling size`: The size of each sample

    - ` [timeout]`: Optional argument to set a timeout for SMT simplification
  - `--smt-iter`:  SMT simplification to each individual facet of the convex hull
    - ` [timeout]`: Optional argument to set a timeout for SMT simplification
  - `--sanity-check`: Perform some sanity check after each new hull.

**_Output_**:

  The program will generate two files.

  - PNML representation of the simplified convex hull.
  - A file with a summary and performance details
    - Example of output file:
